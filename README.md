# Summary of analysis

The folders "PyBank" and "PyPoll" each contain a file called "main.py" that containes the python code for each part of the assignment.

The "main.py" files will finish by printing the results of analysis in the terminal, and saving the results to a text document in the "analysis" folder within PyBank and PyPoll folders.

There is an adidtional Jupyter Notebook file within each folder, "PyBank" and "PyPoll", that was used to quickly check variables, and run segments of the code for testing.
